NEVER invest more you can safely invest.

Investing is GAMBLING there is never a sure shot ever.

Remember, THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, this is life advice 

Never send any money to to any address, wether that be bitcoin, doge, or any other cryptocurrency. 

Do your own Research, the community has your back <3

Be weary of any links that you are opening in your broswer, it can be malicious and unsafe.
